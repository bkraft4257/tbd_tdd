# The Three Laws of TDD (Featuring Kotlin) by Uncle Bob Martin

#
# Over the years, I have come to describe Test Drive Development in terms of three
# simple rules.  They are:
#
#    1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing
#       unit test pass.
#
#    2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail;
#       and compilation failures are failures.
#
#    3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the
#       one failing unit test.

def factors_of(value):
    """
    Factor an integer into a list where the product of the list is equal to the original number.

    :param value: Integer to factor
    :return: List of integers whose product is equal to value.
    """
    # Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script.
    return []  # Press âŒ˜F8 to toggle the breakpoint.
